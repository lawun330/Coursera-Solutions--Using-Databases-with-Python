# Coursera: Using-Databases-with-Python
Most of the files are provided by the instructor.
The assignments need a little modification. 
The modified files are
 * `tracks.py` from Week3
 * `roster.py` from Week4
 
For Week5, you need to add a location into the `where.data` file and run geoload.py and geodump.py.
